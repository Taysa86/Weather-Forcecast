# Weather-Forcecast

# Description
This project was created for the practice of using and chaining API calls. It was to hit an API that retrieves latitude and longitude coordinates from a city search. Then, it should use the lat/lon coordinates received from that API to hit another API that retrieves a 5 day weather forecast. It will also use those lat/lon coordinates to hit another API for the current weather. Unfortunaly this project remains int he future development stage because I fell behind due to my health.

# Usage
Eventually you will be able to visit the HTML page in your browser, input a city in the search area, click submit, and watch the HTML populate with the current weather and 5 day forecast!

A screenshot of what the project currently looks like is found in assets/images.

# Credits
I owe alot of credit to the TA's. I have trouble turning in projects unfinished, and because of this I have struggled to catch up after falling behind. They have encouraged me to turn in the projects before they are ready so that I no longer have missing projects and can focus on our current lessons in the class.
